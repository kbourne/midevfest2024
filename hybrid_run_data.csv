The chart uses GPT 4 prompting to survey a comprehensive list of general purpose technologies using the identification framework detailed therein. Where available, academic literature is also used to assess attributable economic impact. A GPT-4 scoring rubric assesses technology-by-technology impacts. The impact measured directly is matched against the scoring to tune all scores to produce technology-by-technology estimates of economic impact (even when direct measures of economic impact are unattainable). Consistent with General Purpose Technology theory, these technologies are assumed to go through a period of investment in which economic impact is negative before productivity advances begin to realize into economic data. All technologies are assumed to have the same diffusion and realization cycle. If recent technologies are assumed to diffuse more quickly, the current wave would appear steeper.

Forecasts are inherently limited and cannot be relied upon. For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security. Past performance is not indicative of future results.Public BlockchainsUpon large-scale adoption, we believe all money and contracts likely will migrate onto Public Blockchains that enableand verifydigital scarcityand proof of ownership. The financial ecosystem is likely to reconfigure to accommodate the rise of Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts. These technologies increase transparency, reduce the influence of capital and regulatory controls, and collapse contract execution costs. In such a world, Digital Wallets would become increasingly necessary as more assets become money-like, and corporations and consumers adapt to the new financial infrastructure. Corporate structures themselves may be called into question. Multiomic SequencingThe cost to gather, sequence, and understand digital biological data is falling precipitously. Multiomic Technologies provide research scientists, therapeutic organizations and health platforms with unprecedented access to DNA, RNA, protein, and digital health data. Cancer care should transform with pan-cancer blood tests. Multiomic data should feed into novel Precision Therapies using emerging gene editing techniques that target and cure rare diseases and chronic conditions. Multiomics shouldunlock entirely new Programmable Biology capabilities, including the design and synthesis of novel biological constructs with applications across industries, particularly agriculture and food production.  Artificial IntelligenceComputational systems and software that evolve with data can solve intractable problems, automate knowledge work, and accelerate technology’s integration into every economic sector. We believe the adoption of Neural Networks should prove more momentous than the introduction of the internet. At scale these systems will require unprecedented computational resources, and AI-specific compute hardware should dominate the Next Gen Cloud datacenters that train and operate AI models. The potential for end-users is clear: a constellation of AI-driven Intelligent Devices that pervade people's lives, changing the way that they spend, work, and play. The adoption of artificial intelligence should transform every sector, impact every business, and catalyze every innovation platform. Energy Storage Declining costs of Advanced Battery Technology should cause an explosion in form factors, enabling Autonomous Mobility systems that collapse the cost of getting people and things from place to place. Electric drivetrain cost declines should unlock micro-mobility and aerial systems, including flying taxis, enabling business models that transform the landscape of cities. Autonomy should reduce the cost of taxi, delivery, and surveillance by an order of magnitude, enabling frictionless transport that could increase the velocity of e-commerce and make individual car ownership the exception rather than the rule. These innovations combined with large-scale stationary batteries should cause a transformation in energy, substituting electricity for liquid fuel and pushing generation infrastructure towards the edge of the network. RoboticsCatalyzed by artificial intelligence, Adaptive Robots can operate alongside humans and navigate legacy infrastructure, changing the way products are made and sold. 3D Printing should contribute to the digitization of manufacturing, increasing not only the performance and precision of end-use parts but also the resilience of supply chains. Meanwhile, the world’s fastest robots, Reusable Rockets, should continue to reduce the cost of launching satellite constellations and enable uninterruptible connectivity. A nascent innovation platform, robotics could collapse the cost of distance with hypersonic travel, the cost of manufacturing complexity with 3D printers, and the cost of production with AI-guided robots.

The financial ecosystem is likely to reconfigure to accommodate the rise of Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts. These technologies increase transparency, reduce the influence of capital and regulatory controls, and collapse contract execution costs. In such a world, Digital Wallets would become increasingly necessary as more assets become money-like, and corporations and consumers adapt to the new financial infrastructure. Corporate structures themselves may be called into question. Multiomic SequencingThe cost to gather, sequence, and understand digital biological data is falling precipitously. Multiomic Technologies provide research scientists, therapeutic organizations and health platforms with unprecedented access to DNA, RNA, protein, and digital health data. Cancer care should transform with pan-cancer blood tests. Multiomic data should feed into novel Precision Therapies using emerging gene editing techniques that target and cure rare diseases and chronic conditions. Multiomics shouldunlock entirely new Programmable Biology capabilities, including the design and synthesis of novel biological constructs with applications across industries, particularly agriculture and food production.

The chart uses GPT 4 prompting to survey a comprehensive list of general purpose technologies using the identification framework detailed therein. Where available, academic literature is also used to assess attributable economic impact. A GPT-4 scoring rubric assesses technology-by-technology impacts. The impact measured directly is matched against the scoring to tune all scores to produce technology-by-technology estimates of economic impact (even when direct measures of economic impact are unattainable). Consistent with General Purpose Technology theory, these technologies are assumed to go through a period of investment in which economic impact is negative before productivity advances begin to realize into economic data. All technologies are assumed to have the same diffusion and realization cycle. If recent technologies are assumed to diffuse more quickly, the current wave would appear steeper.

The financial ecosystem is likely to reconfigure to accommodate the rise of Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts. These technologies increase transparency, reduce the influence of capital and regulatory controls, and collapse contract execution costs. In such a world, Digital Wallets would become increasingly necessary as more assets become money-like, and corporations and consumers adapt to the new financial infrastructure. Corporate structures themselves may be called into question. Multiomic SequencingThe cost to gather, sequence, and understand digital biological data is falling precipitously. Multiomic Technologies provide research scientists, therapeutic organizations and health platforms with unprecedented access to DNA, RNA, protein, and digital health data. Cancer care should transform with pan-cancer blood tests. Multiomic data should feed into novel Precision Therapies using emerging gene editing techniques that target and cure rare diseases and chronic conditions. Multiomics shouldunlock entirely new Programmable Biology capabilities, including the design and synthesis of novel biological constructs with applications across industries, particularly agriculture and food production.  Artificial IntelligenceComputational systems and software that evolve with data can solve intractable problems, automate knowledge work, and accelerate technology’s integration into every economic sector. We believe the adoption of Neural Networks should prove more momentous than the introduction of the internet. At scale these systems will require unprecedented computational resources, and AI-specific compute hardware should dominate the Next Gen Cloud datacenters that train and operate AI models. The potential for end-users is clear: a constellation of AI-driven Intelligent Devices that pervade people's lives, changing the way that they spend, work, and play. The adoption of artificial intelligence should transform every sector, impact every business, and catalyze every innovation platform. Energy Storage Declining costs of Advanced Battery Technology should cause an explosion in form factors, enabling Autonomous Mobility systems that collapse the cost of getting people and things from place to place. Electric drivetrain cost declines should unlock micro-mobility and aerial systems, including flying taxis, enabling business models that transform the landscape of cities. Autonomy should reduce the cost of taxi, delivery, and surveillance by an order of magnitude, enabling frictionless transport that could increase the velocity of e-commerce and make individual car ownership the exception rather than the rule. These innovations combined with large-scale stationary batteries should cause a transformation in energy, substituting electricity for liquid fuel and pushing generation infrastructure towards the edge of the network. RoboticsCatalyzed by artificial intelligence, Adaptive Robots can operate alongside humans and navigate legacy infrastructure, changing the way products are made and sold. 3D Printing should contribute to the digitization of manufacturing, increasing not only the performance and precision of end-use parts but also the resilience of supply chains. Meanwhile, the world’s fastest robots, Reusable Rockets, should continue to reduce the cost of launching satellite constellations and enable uninterruptible connectivity. A nascent innovation platform, robotics could collapse the cost of distance with hypersonic travel, the cost of manufacturing complexity with 3D printers, and the cost of production with AI-guided robots.

This and other information are contained in the ARK ETFs’ prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting www.ark-funds.com. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing. Investing in securities involves risk and there's no guarantee of principal.Fund Risks: The principal risks of investing in the ARKK include: Equity Securities Risk. The value of the equity securities the Fund holds may fall due to general market and economic conditions. Foreign Securities Risk. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Health Care Sector Risk. The health care sector may be adversely affected by government regulations and government health care programs. Communications Sector Risk. Companies is this sector may be adversely affected by potential obsolescence of products/services, pricing competition, research and development costs, substantial capital requirements and government regulation. Information Technology Sector Risk. Information technology companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Additional risks of investing in ARKK include equity, market, management and non-diversification risks, as well as fluctuations in market value and NAV. Disruptive Innovation Risk. Companies that ARK believes are capitalizing on disruptive innovation and developing technologies to displace older technologies or create new markets may not in fact do so. Companies that initially develop a novel technology may not be able to capitalize on the technology. Companies that develop disruptive technologies may face political or legal attacks from competitors, industry groups or local and national governments. These companies may also be exposed to risks applicable to sectors other than the disruptive innovation theme for which they are chosen, and the securities issued by these companies may underperform the securities of other companies that are primarily focused on a particular theme. The Fund’s exposure to cryptocurrency may change over time and, accordingly, such exposure may not always be represented in the Fund’s portfolio. Many significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of investments in bitcoin are uncertain and an investment in bitcoin may produce income that is not treated as qualifying income for purposes of the income test applicable to regulated investment companies, such as the Fund. GBTC is expected to be treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and therefore an investment by the Fund in GBTC will generally be treated as a direct investment in bitcoin for such purposes. See ‘‘Taxes’’ in the Fund’s SAI for more information. An investment in an ETF is subject to risks and you can lose money on your investment in an ETF. There can be no assurance that the ETF will achieve its investment objective. The ETF’s portfolio is more volatile than broad market averages. Shares of ARKK are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. ETF shares may only be redeemed directly with the ETF at NAV by Authorized Participants, in very large creation units. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns.Portfolio holdings will change and should not be considered as investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any particular security.

This and other information are contained in the ARK ETFs’ prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting www.ark-funds.com. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing. Investing in securities involves risk and there's no guarantee of principal.Fund Risks: The principal risks of investing in the ARKK include: Equity Securities Risk. The value of the equity securities the Fund holds may fall due to general market and economic conditions. Foreign Securities Risk. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Health Care Sector Risk. The health care sector may be adversely affected by government regulations and government health care programs. Communications Sector Risk. Companies is this sector may be adversely affected by potential obsolescence of products/services, pricing competition, research and development costs, substantial capital requirements and government regulation. Information Technology Sector Risk. Information technology companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Additional risks of investing in ARKK include equity, market, management and non-diversification risks, as well as fluctuations in market value and NAV. Disruptive Innovation Risk. Companies that ARK believes are capitalizing on disruptive innovation and developing technologies to displace older technologies or create new markets may not in fact do so. Companies that initially develop a novel technology may not be able to capitalize on the technology. Companies that develop disruptive technologies may face political or legal attacks from competitors, industry groups or local and national governments. These companies may also be exposed to risks applicable to sectors other than the disruptive innovation theme for which they are chosen, and the securities issued by these companies may underperform the securities of other companies that are primarily focused on a particular theme. The Fund’s exposure to cryptocurrency may change over time and, accordingly, such exposure may not always be represented in the Fund’s portfolio. Many significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of investments in bitcoin are uncertain and an investment in bitcoin may produce income that is not treated as qualifying income for purposes of the income test applicable to regulated investment companies, such as the Fund. GBTC is expected to be treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and therefore an investment by the Fund in GBTC will generally be treated as a direct investment in bitcoin for such purposes. See ‘‘Taxes’’ in the Fund’s SAI for more information. An investment in an ETF is subject to risks and you can lose money on your investment in an ETF. There can be no assurance that the ETF will achieve its investment objective. The ETF’s portfolio is more volatile than broad market averages. Shares of ARKK are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. ETF shares may only be redeemed directly with the ETF at NAV by Authorized Participants, in very large creation units. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns.Portfolio holdings will change and should not be considered as investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any particular security.

This and other information are contained in the ARK ETFs’ prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting www.ark-funds.com. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing. Investing in securities involves risk and there's no guarantee of principal.Fund Risks: The principal risks of investing in the ARKK include: Equity Securities Risk. The value of the equity securities the Fund holds may fall due to general market and economic conditions. Foreign Securities Risk. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Health Care Sector Risk. The health care sector may be adversely affected by government regulations and government health care programs. Communications Sector Risk. Companies is this sector may be adversely affected by potential obsolescence of products/services, pricing competition, research and development costs, substantial capital requirements and government regulation. Information Technology Sector Risk. Information technology companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Additional risks of investing in ARKK include equity, market, management and non-diversification risks, as well as fluctuations in market value and NAV. Disruptive Innovation Risk. Companies that ARK believes are capitalizing on disruptive innovation and developing technologies to displace older technologies or create new markets may not in fact do so. Companies that initially develop a novel technology may not be able to capitalize on the technology. Companies that develop disruptive technologies may face political or legal attacks from competitors, industry groups or local and national governments. These companies may also be exposed to risks applicable to sectors other than the disruptive innovation theme for which they are chosen, and the securities issued by these companies may underperform the securities of other companies that are primarily focused on a particular theme. The Fund’s exposure to cryptocurrency may change over time and, accordingly, such exposure may not always be represented in the Fund’s portfolio. Many significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of investments in bitcoin are uncertain and an investment in bitcoin may produce income that is not treated as qualifying income for purposes of the income test applicable to regulated investment companies, such as the Fund. GBTC is expected to be treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and therefore an investment by the Fund in GBTC will generally be treated as a direct investment in bitcoin for such purposes. See ‘‘Taxes’’ in the Fund’s SAI for more information. An investment in an ETF is subject to risks and you can lose money on your investment in an ETF. There can be no assurance that the ETF will achieve its investment objective. The ETF’s portfolio is more volatile than broad market averages. Shares of ARKK are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. ETF shares may only be redeemed directly with the ETF at NAV by Authorized Participants, in very large creation units. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns.Portfolio holdings will change and should not be considered as investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any particular security.

The financial ecosystem is likely to reconfigure to accommodate the rise of Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts. These technologies increase transparency, reduce the influence of capital and regulatory controls, and collapse contract execution costs. In such a world, Digital Wallets would become increasingly necessary as more assets become money-like, and corporations and consumers adapt to the new financial infrastructure. Corporate structures themselves may be called into question. Multiomic SequencingThe cost to gather, sequence, and understand digital biological data is falling precipitously. Multiomic Technologies provide research scientists, therapeutic organizations and health platforms with unprecedented access to DNA, RNA, protein, and digital health data. Cancer care should transform with pan-cancer blood tests. Multiomic data should feed into novel Precision Therapies using emerging gene editing techniques that target and cure rare diseases and chronic conditions. Multiomics shouldunlock entirely new Programmable Biology capabilities, including the design and synthesis of novel biological constructs with applications across industries, particularly agriculture and food production.  Artificial IntelligenceComputational systems and software that evolve with data can solve intractable problems, automate knowledge work, and accelerate technology’s integration into every economic sector. We believe the adoption of Neural Networks should prove more momentous than the introduction of the internet. At scale these systems will require unprecedented computational resources, and AI-specific compute hardware should dominate the Next Gen Cloud datacenters that train and operate AI models. The potential for end-users is clear: a constellation of AI-driven Intelligent Devices that pervade people's lives, changing the way that they spend, work, and play. The adoption of artificial intelligence should transform every sector, impact every business, and catalyze every innovation platform. Energy Storage Declining costs of Advanced Battery Technology should cause an explosion in form factors, enabling Autonomous Mobility systems that collapse the cost of getting people and things from place to place. Electric drivetrain cost declines should unlock micro-mobility and aerial systems, including flying taxis, enabling business models that transform the landscape of cities. Autonomy should reduce the cost of taxi, delivery, and surveillance by an order of magnitude, enabling frictionless transport that could increase the velocity of e-commerce and make individual car ownership the exception rather than the rule. These innovations combined with large-scale stationary batteries should cause a transformation in energy, substituting electricity for liquid fuel and pushing generation infrastructure towards the edge of the network. RoboticsCatalyzed by artificial intelligence, Adaptive Robots can operate alongside humans and navigate legacy infrastructure, changing the way products are made and sold. 3D Printing should contribute to the digitization of manufacturing, increasing not only the performance and precision of end-use parts but also the resilience of supply chains. Meanwhile, the world’s fastest robots, Reusable Rockets, should continue to reduce the cost of launching satellite constellations and enable uninterruptible connectivity. A nascent innovation platform, robotics could collapse the cost of distance with hypersonic travel, the cost of manufacturing complexity with 3D printers, and the cost of production with AI-guided robots.

 'Sources: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2024. This ARK analysis is based on a range of underlying sources, including Bekar et al. 2017, which may be provided upon request. The chart uses GPT 4 prompting to survey a comprehensive list of general purpose technologies using the identification framework detailed therein. Where available, academic literature is also used to assess attributable economic impact. A GPT-4 scoring rubric assesses technology-by-technology impacts. The impact measured directly is matched against the scoring to tune all scores to produce technology-by-technology estimates of economic impact (even when direct measures of economic impact are unattainable). Consistent with General Purpose Technology theory, these technologies are assumed to go through a period of investment in which economic impact is negative before productivity advances begin to realize into economic data. All technologies are assumed to have the same diffusion and realization cycle. If recent technologies are assumed to diffuse more quickly, the current wave would appear steeper.

Energy Storage Declining costs of Advanced Battery Technology should cause an explosion in form factors, enabling Autonomous Mobility systems that collapse the cost of getting people and things from place to place. Electric drivetrain cost declines should unlock micro-mobility and aerial systems, including flying taxis, enabling business models that transform the landscape of cities. Autonomy should reduce the cost of taxi, delivery, and surveillance by an order of magnitude, enabling frictionless transport that could increase the velocity of e-commerce and make individual car ownership the exception rather than the rule. These innovations combined with large-scale stationary batteries should cause a transformation in energy, substituting electricity for liquid fuel and pushing generation infrastructure towards the edge of the network. RoboticsCatalyzed by artificial intelligence, Adaptive Robots can operate alongside humans and navigate legacy infrastructure, changing the way products are made and sold. 3D Printing should contribute to the digitization of manufacturing, increasing not only the performance and precision of end-use parts but also the resilience of supply chains. Meanwhile, the world’s fastest robots, Reusable Rockets, should continue to reduce the cost of launching satellite constellations and enable uninterruptible connectivity. A nascent innovation platform, robotics could collapse the cost of distance with hypersonic travel, the cost of manufacturing complexity with 3D printers, and the cost of production with AI-guided robots.

 'Sources: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2024. This ARK analysis is based on a range of underlying sources, including Bekar et al. 2017, which may be provided upon request. The chart uses GPT 4 prompting to survey a comprehensive list of general purpose technologies using the identification framework detailed therein. Where available, academic literature is also used to assess attributable economic impact. A GPT-4 scoring rubric assesses technology-by-technology impacts. The impact measured directly is matched against the scoring to tune all scores to produce technology-by-technology estimates of economic impact (even when direct measures of economic impact are unattainable). Consistent with General Purpose Technology theory, these technologies are assumed to go through a period of investment in which economic impact is negative before productivity advances begin to realize into economic data. All technologies are assumed to have the same diffusion and realization cycle. If recent technologies are assumed to diffuse more quickly, the current wave would appear steeper.

This ARK analysis is based on a range of underlying sources, including Bekar et al. 2017, which may be provided upon request. The chart uses GPT 4 prompting to survey a comprehensive list of general purpose technologies using the identification framework detailed therein. Where available, academic literature is also used to assess attributable economic impact. A GPT-4 scoring rubric assesses technology-by-technology impacts. The impact measured directly is matched against the scoring to tune all scores to produce technology-by-technology estimates of economic impact (even when direct measures of economic impact are unattainable). Consistent with General Purpose Technology theory, these technologies are assumed to go through a period of investment in which economic impact is negative before productivity advances begin to realize into economic data. All technologies are assumed to have the same diffusion and realization cycle. If recent technologies are assumed to diffuse more quickly, the current wave would appear steeper.

The health care sector may be adversely affected by government regulations and government health care programs. Communications Sector Risk. Companies is this sector may be adversely affected by potential obsolescence of products/services, pricing competition, research and development costs, substantial capital requirements and government regulation. Information Technology Sector Risk. Information technology companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Additional risks of investing in ARKK include equity, market, management and non-diversification risks, as well as fluctuations in market value and NAV. Disruptive Innovation Risk. Companies that ARK believes are capitalizing on disruptive innovation and developing technologies to displace older technologies or create new markets may not in fact do so. Companies that initially develop a novel technology may not be able to capitalize on the technology. Companies that develop disruptive technologies may face political or legal attacks from competitors, industry groups or local and national governments.

The financial ecosystem is likely to reconfigure to accommodate the rise of Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts. These technologies increase transparency, reduce the influence of capital and regulatory controls, and collapse contract execution costs. In such a world, Digital Wallets would become increasingly necessary as more assets become money-like, and corporations and consumers adapt to the new financial infrastructure. Corporate structures themselves may be called into question. Multiomic SequencingThe cost to gather, sequence, and understand digital biological data is falling precipitously. Multiomic Technologies provide research scientists, therapeutic organizations and health platforms with unprecedented access to DNA, RNA, protein, and digital health data. Cancer care should transform with pan-cancer blood tests. Multiomic data should feed into novel Precision Therapies using emerging gene editing techniques that target and cure rare diseases and chronic conditions. Multiomics shouldunlock entirely new Programmable Biology capabilities, including the design and synthesis of novel biological constructs with applications across industries, particularly agriculture and food production.  Artificial IntelligenceComputational systems and software that evolve with data can solve intractable problems, automate knowledge work, and accelerate technology’s integration into every economic sector. We believe the adoption of Neural Networks should prove more momentous than the introduction of the internet. At scale these systems will require unprecedented computational resources, and AI-specific compute hardware should dominate the Next Gen Cloud datacenters that train and operate AI models. The potential for end-users is clear: a constellation of AI-driven Intelligent Devices that pervade people's lives, changing the way that they spend, work, and play. The adoption of artificial intelligence should transform every sector, impact every business, and catalyze every innovation platform. Energy Storage Declining costs of Advanced Battery Technology should cause an explosion in form factors, enabling Autonomous Mobility systems that collapse the cost of getting people and things from place to place. Electric drivetrain cost declines should unlock micro-mobility and aerial systems, including flying taxis, enabling business models that transform the landscape of cities. Autonomy should reduce the cost of taxi, delivery, and surveillance by an order of magnitude, enabling frictionless transport that could increase the velocity of e-commerce and make individual car ownership the exception rather than the rule. These innovations combined with large-scale stationary batteries should cause a transformation in energy, substituting electricity for liquid fuel and pushing generation infrastructure towards the edge of the network. RoboticsCatalyzed by artificial intelligence, Adaptive Robots can operate alongside humans and navigate legacy infrastructure, changing the way products are made and sold. 3D Printing should contribute to the digitization of manufacturing, increasing not only the performance and precision of end-use parts but also the resilience of supply chains. Meanwhile, the world’s fastest robots, Reusable Rockets, should continue to reduce the cost of launching satellite constellations and enable uninterruptible connectivity. A nascent innovation platform, robotics could collapse the cost of distance with hypersonic travel, the cost of manufacturing complexity with 3D printers, and the cost of production with AI-guided robots.

RoboticsCatalyzed by artificial intelligence, Adaptive Robots can operate alongside humans and navigate legacy infrastructure, changing the way products are made and sold. 3D Printing should contribute to the digitization of manufacturing, increasing not only the performance and precision of end-use parts but also the resilience of supply chains. Meanwhile, the world’s fastest robots, Reusable Rockets, should continue to reduce the cost of launching satellite constellations and enable uninterruptible connectivity. A nascent innovation platform, robotics could collapse the cost of distance with hypersonic travel, the cost of manufacturing complexity with 3D printers, and the cost of production with AI-guided robots.

The chart uses GPT 4 prompting to survey a comprehensive list of general purpose technologies using the identification framework detailed therein. Where available, academic literature is also used to assess attributable economic impact. A GPT-4 scoring rubric assesses technology-by-technology impacts. The impact measured directly is matched against the scoring to tune all scores to produce technology-by-technology estimates of economic impact (even when direct measures of economic impact are unattainable). Consistent with General Purpose Technology theory, these technologies are assumed to go through a period of investment in which economic impact is negative before productivity advances begin to realize into economic data. All technologies are assumed to have the same diffusion and realization cycle. If recent technologies are assumed to diffuse more quickly, the current wave would appear steeper.
